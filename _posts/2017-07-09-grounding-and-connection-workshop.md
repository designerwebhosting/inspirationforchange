Join me on a journey to explore the gentle loving depths of Mother Earth.
This workshop will help provide you with a beautiful and deep connection to Gaia's amazing love and
strength, which in turn enables you to connect with higher frequencyâ€™s and dimensions leading you to
source.

We will cover:

- Identifying you own unique way of connecting to Mother Earth.
- The beauty of each connection to Gaia and Source.
- The amazing feeling of your energy being supported and connected.
- How these connections can help you personally to find balance and connection in your every day life.

For those who work in healing or spiritual practices by grounding and connecting it helps you hear
clearer, work stronger, feel less drained and feel safer on this planet.
This workshop is for anyone who struggles to keep their feel on the ground, for those who have been
called to work at higher frequencies or those called to work deeper with Gaia, or anyone who wishes to
find balance and connection.

This workshop will help you connect in a way you never have before.
