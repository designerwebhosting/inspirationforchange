My name is Heather and I’m 50.

Before going to Ann my brain was a total mess, I was unable to concentrate, I had mood swings, thoughts I didn’t want to think about and neighbours who bully.

I suffer terrible sleep and sleep walking. A numerous amounts of trauma from my past.

Today one week later,

I feel like a different person. My mind is so clear, I’ve never experienced this in my life (not even counseling has made me feel like this).

I feel brighter, happier, relaxed, less anxious, people who upset me I don’t think about anymore.

I’m loads more positive.

In the future I would definitely, definitely use Life Retuning again and would recommend this to my friends.

Thank you very much Ann, you’ve made me feel much better.

From Heather”

I saw Heather for just one session of an hour and a half.
