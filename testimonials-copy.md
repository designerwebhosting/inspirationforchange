<p>My name is Heather and I am 50.</p>

<p>Before going to Ann my brain was a total mess, I was unable to concentrate, I had mood swings, thoughts I didn’t want to think about and neighbours who bully.</p>

<p>I suffer terrible sleep and sleep walking. A numerous amounts of trauma from my past.</p>

<p>Today one week later,</p>

<p>I feel like a different person. My mind is so clear, I’ve never experienced this in my life (not even counselling has made me feel like this).</p>

<p>I feel brighter, happier, relaxed, less anxious, people who upset me I don’t think about any more.</p>

<p>I’m loads more positive.</p>

<p>In the future I would definitely, definitely use Life Retuning again and would recommend this to my friends.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Ann, you’ve made me feel much better.</p>

<p>From Heather</p>

<p>Hi Ann, I just wanted to let you know what has been happening since our session. After our session I felt a lot better about going into hospital for my operation, it did not seem as daunting and the level of fear and anger seemed completely gone.</p>

<p>I no longer got anxious when I thought about going into the hospital. On the day of the operation I was a lot calmer than usual and even though I did get a little agitated when I was kept hanging around for a couple of hours the feelings where not to bad.</p>

<p>After surgery the promises the hospital had made where not fulfilled leaving me feeling stressed and claustrophobic, the lack of communication increased these feelings.</p>

<p>What I found most amazing is that virtually as soon as I left the hospital the feelings of anger at the doctors for not helping me in the way they had promised left me. I was telling my friend about what happened and she remarked that I sounded really calm considering what had happened. When I talked about it with mum and friends I found that I was not really angry about it more disappointed at being let down.</p>

<p>It’s as if the stress and anger I felt at the time I was in the hospital is like a distant memory. Even though there have been a few issues after the surgery this still has not made me angry. It’s quite scary how my mental attitude has changed when it comes to what happened and how I would have dealt with to how I did deal with it.</p>

<p>My recovery continues steadily and I’m due to see the doctors in a few weeks, when I think about what it want to say to them about the care after the surgery, I am calm and none of the old feelings surface.</p>

<p>I am so pleased that you offered me the opportunity to work with you on releasing all the old junk from my auric fields and past lives in such a gentle and un-traumatic way. I feel this has been the main reason for me to be able to deal with these issues and my hospital phobia in a way that is more positively conducive to my mental and physical recovery from the experience.</p>

<p>I feel I will also be more prepared and less anxious about the surgeries I have to have in the future.</p>

<p>For this I thank you from the depths of my soul. Magenta</p></div>

<p>I have over the last three years been through the process of psycho-dynamic counselling. It has helped me immensely to deal with the traumas of my life. I have also been using flower essences to assist my vibration in a gentle way with the emotional upheaval that this type of personal work uncovers.</p>

<p>I felt however that a deeper unhappiness was not being dealt with and I needed a release. I discovered life retuning via a positive living event and met Ann who I felt very comfortable with to undertake this work.</p>

<p>As many people explain our lives are like onion layers and in order to reveal the truth within the layers need to be peeled away and the truth exposed to the light. Ann explains this process as loosening the knots.</p>

<p>It is not a logical process and for me as a person with an analytical mind it is a difficult concept to understand in terms of jumping from different ages to experiences which are buried deep within. In fact I almost cancelled the first session due to my fears and trepidation of what it might uncover.</p>

<p>After two sessions I can honestly say I feel the release of old bonds. I can describe it as all of the shackles falling away and I am able to soar like an eagle. I feel confident that I have left my current and past life traumas behind and I am ready to live the life I deserve to live. I don't feel ashamed to be me any more and I accept myself for who I am.</p>

<p>In terms of outcomes its early days but I am planning to move house, change job and start a new business venture in the next few months. I have to say I think these would have been "pipe dreams" before!</p>

<p>Thank you very much Anne for your work which has benefited me more that I could ever put into words.</p></div>
