&quot;My name is Heather and I am 50.



Before going to Ann my brain was a total mess, I was unable to concentrate, I had mood swings, thoughts I didn&rsquo;t want to think about and neighbours who bully.



I suffer terrible sleep and sleep walking. A numerous amounts of trauma from my past.



Today one week later,



I feel like a different person. My mind is so clear, I&rsquo;ve never experienced this in my life (not even counselling has made me feel like this).



I feel brighter, happier, relaxed, less anxious, people who upset me I don&rsquo;t think about any more.



I&rsquo;m loads more positive.



In the future I would definitely, definitely use Life Retuning again and would recommend this to my friends.&lt;/p&gt;



Thank you very much Ann, you&rsquo;ve made me feel much better.



From Heather&quot;
