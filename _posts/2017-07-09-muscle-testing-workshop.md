This is what muscle testing can give you. Muscle testing is a form of communication allowing to
tap in to our own wisdom and truth.
Dr Weissman describes muscle testing in brilliantly “It bypasses the conscious mind and
therefore accesses the inner wisdom of the body, it can be used for mental, emotional, spiritual
issues, body functions, food sensitivities, helps us make healthier decisions in every aspect of a
persons life.”
Muscle testing is simple to learn and an amazing skill to cultivate, it enables you to be able to
test in any situation or environment.

On this workshop you will discover how muscle works and why sometimes it doesn't and how to
rectify that. We will explore and have a play with many different forms of self muscle testing and
have a go with dowsing rods and pendulums as alternatives to muscle testing. By the end of the
workshop you will have identified your own unique method of self muscle testing.

Having the skill of self muscle testing is a wonderful as it can help you communicate with
yourself on a whole other level.
Muscle testing can help with choosing foods, the route home, what you wear for an interview,
indecision, to helping you identify self limiting beliefs and checking the health of your chakras.
