&quot;After two sessions (with Ann) I can honestly say I feel the release of old bonds. I can describe it as all of the shackles falling away and I am able to soar like an eagle. I feel confident that I have left my current and past life traumas behind and I am ready to live the life I deserve to live. I don&#39;t feel ashamed to be me any more and I accept myself for who I am.



I have over the last three years been through the process of psycho-dynamic counselling. It has helped me immensely to deal with the traumas of my life. I have also been using flower essences to assist my vibration in a gentle way with the emotional upheaval that this type of personal work uncovers.



I felt however that a deeper unhappiness was not being dealt with and I needed a release. I discovered life retuning via a positive living event and met Ann who I felt very comfortable with to undertake this work.



As many people explain our lives are like onion layers and in order to reveal the truth within the layers need to be peeled away and the truth exposed to the light. Ann explains this process as loosening the knots.



It is not a logical process and for me as a person with an analytical mind it is a difficult concept to understand in terms of jumping from different ages to experiences which are buried deep within. In fact I almost cancelled the first session due to my fears and trepidation of what it might uncover.



After two sessions I can honestly say I feel the release of old bonds. I can describe it as all of the shackles falling away and I am able to soar like an eagle. I feel confident that I have left my current and past life traumas behind and I am ready to live the life I deserve to live. I don&#39;t feel ashamed to be me any more and I accept myself for who I am.



In terms of outcomes its early days but I am planning to move house, change job and start a new business venture in the next few months. I have to say I think these would have been &quot;pipe dreams&quot; before!



Thank you very much Anne for your work which has benefited me more that I could ever put into words.&quot;
