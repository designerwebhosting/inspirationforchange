My name is Heather and I am 50.

Before going to Ann my brain was a total mess, I was unable to concentrate, I had mood swings, thoughts I didn?t want to think about and neighbours who bully.
<!--more-->

I suffer terrible sleep and sleep walking. A numerous amounts of trauma from my past.

Today one week later,

I feel like a different person. My mind is so clear, I?ve never experienced this in my life (not even counselling has made me feel like this).

I feel brighter, happier, relaxed, less anxious, people who upset me I don?t think about any more.

I?m loads more positive.

In the future I would definitely, definitely use Life Retuning again and would recommend this to my friends.</p>

Thank you very much Ann, you?ve made me feel much better.

From Heather"
