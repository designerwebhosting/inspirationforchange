			<h3>Who am I ?</h3>
			<p>I am Ann. I am intuitive, sensitive and big hearted, my passion is to empower others to bring their lives into balance. Helping someone untangle the knots of their lives and seeing them realise that they have found release, is the highlight of my day. Creativity plays a big role in my life and one of my talents is glass fusion, creating stunning amazing unique pieces of fused glass. You can have a look at some of my work at www.vibrantglassart.com. I also run courses in fused glass for you to have a go at making your own  glass creations. I will be running courses here on Inspiration for Change which combines creating with glass with my other therapies. I am a qualified Life Returner, and Colour therapist.</p>

			<p>So what makes me qualified to help you?<br>My life, my journey, to borrow lyrics from a song....</p>
			<p>This old world can be cruel sometimes<br>When you're looking for answers<br>You can't seem to find<br>No one understands what you're going through</p>
			<p>Oh I know it can get lonely out there<br>When you feel like nobody cares<br>Well you look around thinking<br>If they only knew<br>Well I do</p>
			<p>I've felt the chill of this world cut down to the bone<br>I've walked many a mile down this road on my own<br>I've been through hell on my knees<br>Come face to face with the devil<br>And I know that it's hard to believe<br>
But it gets better</p>

			<p>This has been my life, from feeling different to every one else, never feeling like I fit in, to growing up with constant mood swings, which looking back I can identify as depression. To finding love and getting married, having children, all the while trying hard to keep my chin above water creating a barrier around myself, looking for direction/purpose. It took rock bottom for me to start my journey to finding empowerment and my true self. My climb began with creativity, I started making paper mache sculptures this evolved into my glass work. My creativity has supported my growth and provided a well needed outlet. The glass work lead me to qualify as a colour therapist and to use colour intuitively.</p>
			<p>I have tried a lot of different therapies on my journey back to balance, some worked and helped at the time, but they never got to the seed of the problem. I struggled with depression for a long time and some days it felt like going through hell on my knees. That stage of my life changed forever when I went along to a talk and heard Ildiko Scurr talk about Life Retuning. She demonstrated with a volunteer how she worked. By using energy she could take a negative emotion from a 10 (very high) to a 0 (nothing) in minutes. The volunteer couldn't even remember what the problem was. I booked a session with Ildiko and she got to the seed cause of my  depression, and from that moment I have been depression free. I have now completed the Life Retuning course, a journey of self discovery in its self, and am able to help to others the way Ildiko helped me, the results are amazing.</p>
			<p>The song finishes with these words</p>
			<p>Time is a healer but we can't see how<br>When you're caught in the moment<br>And the hurting is now<br>We don't wanna see that maybe somethings<br>Weren't meant to figure out</
			<p>This old world can be cruel sometimes<br>When you're looking for answers<br>Well just keep in mind<br>No you're not alone<br>We're all trying to find our way through this life</p>
			<p>I want you to know, there is an answer out there for you and you are are not alone.</p>
