So you've seen the seven workshops ready and waiting just for you.

You know what we will be covering and your interested in learning more, so you want to know when,
where and how much. I can let you know how much but I am hoping you can help me with the when and
where.

This is how you can help, if you would like to do a workshop and are willing to host the workshop at your
venue with the minimum numbers for the workshop booking in and attending, I will give you your place
free as a thank you for being the host.

If a group over the minimum numbers would like to do a workshop at my venue in Calne, Wiltshire and
as a group book and pay in one go, I will give a workshop place free to that group. This means someone
can have a free place or you all enjoy a discount.

When? Lets have a chat, check our diaries and arrange a date. Contact details: phone 01794 388078,

email: ann@inspirationforchange.co.uk or send me a message.
